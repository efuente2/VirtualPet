# Java Virtual Pet Project

This is a Java Virtual Pet project that simulates the experience of owning and interacting with a virtual pet. The project provides a user-friendly interface for taking care of the virtual pet's needs, such as feeding, playing, and monitoring its health. The virtual pet has various attributes and behaviors that change over time and require the user's attention to ensure its well-being.

## Getting Started

To run the Java Virtual Pet project on your local machine, please follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use a package manager for your operating system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the project files.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

4. Compile the Java source files by running the following command:

   ```shell
   javac *.java
   ```

5. Once the compilation is successful, run the project using the following command:

   ```shell
   java VirtualPetApp
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with your virtual pet.

## Features

### 1. Pet Status and Needs

The virtual pet has various attributes and needs that are displayed on the screen, including:

- **Hunger**: The pet gets hungry over time and needs to be fed to maintain its health.
- **Thirst**: The pet gets thirsty and requires water to stay hydrated.
- **Happiness**: The pet's happiness level indicates its overall mood and well-being.
- **Health**: The pet's health status determines its overall condition.
- **Energy**: The pet's energy level affects its activity and ability to perform actions.

### 2. Interactions

You can interact with the virtual pet through a set of actions, including:

- **Feed**: Provide food to satisfy the pet's hunger.
- **Water**: Give the pet water to quench its thirst.
- **Play**: Engage in playtime activities with the pet to boost its happiness.
- **Sleep**: Allow the pet to rest and replenish its energy.
- **Check Status**: Display the current status of the pet, including all its attributes and needs.

### 3. Real-Time Updates

The virtual pet's attributes and needs change over time, even when you're not interacting with it. The pet's status is continuously updated on the screen, reflecting its changing conditions.

### 4. Winning and Losing Conditions

The game continues until certain winning or losing conditions are met. The virtual pet can either become extremely unhealthy and perish, or you can successfully fulfill its needs and keep it happy and healthy.
